    * Add Integer#from_mongo. [cheald][#533]
    * Normalize IDs passed to #find!, so that it may accept an unsplatted array of IDs, just like #find. [cheald][#468][#469].
    * Performance Improvements to: typecasting, identity map, etc. (see a60b04c) [cheald]
    * Upgrade safe semantics to be consistent with the new MongoClient safe semantics (:safe => true is now on by default) [cheald]
    * Various performance fixes mostly related to avoid extraneous method invocation [cheald]
    * Optimization: use key? [jnunemaker]

    * Only add the _type key to inherited classes when they have the same collection as their parent. Classes with a different collection name don't need the SCI keys. [cheald]

    * Key serialization mutates model state when using key Array with option typecast [Oktavilla]
    * Be more clear when specifying which version of JRuby mongo_mapper is tested against [tad.hosford@gmail.com]
    * Fix db:drop to match everything but system exactly [banyan]

    * When performing Time#to_mongo, round times off to milliseconds and discard microseconds. [cheald][#455]
    * Permit the use of #insert and #update in addition to #save, so that we can catch and raise errors in safe mode. [cheald][#398].
    * Add critera_hash when single collection inherited. [cheald][#454]
    * Fix issues with set_collection_name nullifying SCI on 1.8 [cheald]
    * Disable SCI when an inherited model explicitly changes its collection. Closes [cheald][#396]
    * Validate key names. Explicitly disallow keys named `id` since they aren't reachable via plucky due to key normalization. Validate key names via regex. [cheald][#399].
    * Don't attempt to create a connection when inheriting classes if one does not already exist. [cheald][#460]
    * Accept blocks passed to new/build/create/create! on documents and associations. [cheald][#352]

    * Provide a fix for many associations not yielding to each in callbacks. [jnunemaker]
    * Support non-ObjectID ids being given to modifiers. [jnunemaker]
    * Inherit connection and database name. Subclasses were not getting these before. Only collection name was inherited. [jnunemaker][#420][#424]

    * Bump plucky requirement to 0.6.5 [cheald]
